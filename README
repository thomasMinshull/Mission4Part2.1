Mission4Part2.1 is a simple app built by Tom Minshull under the mentorship of Michael Thompson. 

The app uses the cocoapods SDWebImage, MBProgressHub, and FlickrKit, to pull a feed of images from flicker's API, which are displayed in a UITableView. The User can then click the save button in each UITableViewCell to save the picture to the users camera roll.
